# Testing egui and tokio
Just my demo project on how one can use tokio to make a fluid egui user interface when processing data from the internet.
The primitives are no located in the "lazy_async_promise" crate, which can be found on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/lazy_async_promise) 
and [github](https://github.com/ChrisRega/lazy_async_promise).
Maybe you will find them useful, too :)
